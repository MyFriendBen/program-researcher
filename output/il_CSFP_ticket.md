# Implement CSFP (IL) Program

## Program: CSFP
**State**: IL
**White Label**: il
**Research Date**: 2026-01-29

## Overview

### Eligibility Criteria Coverage

- **Evaluable criteria**: 4
- **Data gaps**: 5

4 of 9 core CSFP eligibility criteria can be evaluated with current screener fields. The evaluable criteria cover the most fundamental requirements: income (130% FPL), age (60+), state residency, and WIC dual participation prohibition. Key gaps include service area mapping, institutionalization status, and citizenship verification.

### Recommendations
- HIGH PRIORITY: Add service area mapping for Illinois CSFP local agencies to properly screen geographic eligibility
- MEDIUM PRIORITY: Consider adding institutionalization status field to capture nursing home/assisted living residents
- MEDIUM PRIORITY: Add citizenship/immigration status field for more accurate eligibility screening
- LOW PRIORITY: Nutrition education participation requirement is typically handled during enrollment, not screening
